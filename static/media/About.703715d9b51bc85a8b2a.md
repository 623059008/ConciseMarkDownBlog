# About Me

My name is Tao Ren (Tempest).

I am a graduate student in the **University of Pittsburgh** with **Information Science** major.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for a year as a software engineer at **[Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en/)**, [Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/), in the Mobile Technology Team.

I was responsible for developing **[Alipay Wealth Shop](https://medium.com/alipay-and-the-world/how-alipay-changed-the-way-china-invests-and-helped-a-fund-grow-400-times-over-9c13f77af4b6)**, dynamic templates, and live-streaming components with billions of visitors.

I got my Bachelor's Degree at the **Southern University of Science and Technology**, which spent four years teaching me the knowledge, passion, and spirit of continuous improvement needed to become a qualified software engineer and a Computer Science scholar.

For now, my interests include Frontend and Backend development, Software Engineering, Game Development (H5 Game, Unity, Unreal, Blender), BlockChain, Web3 and AGI.

I'm looking for full-time software development engineer position and I will graduate at Apr 2023.
