## My Frontend Journey

I have been in Full Stack Community more than 9 years.

### jQuery Web Application + PHP

### React + Django/Flask

### React + Node.js

### HTML5 2D Game: Egret

### Mini-Program: Wechat and Alipay

### Vue + TypeScript + Tornado

### React + Vite + TypeScript

### React
When I firstly used React, it was only the initial stage with JSX. Developers in frontend community were seeking a solution like JS template engine to move from PHP HTML template to JS HTML Template. That's how jQuery become popular and how Google developers have Angular.
And in recent years, there are more and more changes like React Hooks, Function Components, Redux and various components library. I have always been at the forefront of the front-end community, adhering to the philosophy of lifelong learning.
