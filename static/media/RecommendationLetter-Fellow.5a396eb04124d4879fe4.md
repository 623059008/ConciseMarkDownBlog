Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to highly recommend Tao for the Electric Engineering PhD at UCR. As a schoolfellow of Tao at SUSTech, I have the pleasure of knowing Tao for the past 6 years and have been consistently impressed by his dedication to his studies and his strong technical skills.

Throughout his undergraduate studies, Tao has consistently demonstrated a strong foundation in his field and a passion for learning. He has received high marks in his courses and has actively participated in class discussions, consistently contributing valuable insights. In addition, Tao has also been very involved in extracurricular activities, including internships at companies such as Ant Group, Alibaba, where he worked for over 1 year and completed many excellent work, which demonstrating his ability to apply his knowledge in real-world settings.

I have no doubt that Tao would thrive in a PhD program. I recommend Tao to apply a PhD program and make significant contributions to the electric engineering field.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
