# About Me

My name is Tao Ren (Tempest).

I'm a graduate student at the **University of Pittsburgh** studying **Information Science**.

Before being a graduate student, I worked for one year as a software engineer at **Ant Group**, Alibaba, in Mobile Technology Team.

I was responsible for developing **Alipay Wealth Shop**, some dynamic templates, and live-streaming components with **billions** of visitors. That was an arduous task, especially in the Chinsese New Year period.

I finished my Bachelor's Degree at the **Southern University of Science and Technology**, which spent four years to teach me the knowledge, passion, and spirit of continuous improvement needed to become a qualified software engineer and a Computer Science scholar.

I love the beautiful cities, Hangzhou and Shenzhen. I really miss them, miss every day and night I spent there.

For now, my interests include Frontend and Backend development, Software Engineering, Game Development (H5 Game, Unity, Unreal, Blender), BlockChain, Web3 and AGI.
