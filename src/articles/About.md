# About Me

My name is Tao Ren (Tempest).

I'm a graduate student at the **University of Pittsburgh** studying **Information Science**.

Before being a graduate student, I worked at **[Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en/)**, [Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/), in Mobile Technology Team as a frontend software engineer.

I was responsible for developing **[Alipay Wealth Shop](https://medium.com/alipay-and-the-world/how-alipay-changed-the-way-china-invests-and-helped-a-fund-grow-400-times-over-9c13f77af4b6)**, some dynamic templates, and live-streaming components with **billions** of visitors. That was an arduous task, especially during the Chinese New Year period.

I finished my Bachelor's Degree at the **Southern University of Science and Technology**, which spent four years teaching me the knowledge, passion, and spirit of continuous improvement needed to become a qualified software engineer and a Computer Science scholar.

I love the beautiful cities, Hangzhou and Shenzhen. I do miss them, miss every day and night I spent there.

For now, my interests include FullStack development(Open-source community & dev tools ecosystem), Saas Development(Cooperative office, Software Development Tools, Low-Code Platforms), Game Development (H5 Game, Unity, Unreal, Blender), BlockChain(ETH & BNB community), Web3(NFT, Meta & DAO) and AGI(AIGC, GPT, Stable Diffusion, GAN, Object Detection, Autopilot).

I'm looking for full-time software development engineer position and I will graduate at Apr 2023.
