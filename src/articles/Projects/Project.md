### School Projects

> Some initial, for learning/homework purpose projects
> Hope I have free time to complete them and push them to the Awesome Projects list.


- [Best2buy](https://github.com/623059008/Best2Buy): A lightweight e-commerce web application powered by Egg.js, jQuery, Bootstrap and Mysql.
- [Backlog](https://github.com/623059008/Backlog): A online memo web application using Django, React and PostgreSQL.
- [FGO H5Game](https://github.com/623059008/FateGrend0rder): A FGO HTML5 game, I was planning to develop idle games (incremental games). It's not boring, but the technology is too naive to update: jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL.
- [Try Konva](https://github.com/623059008/KonvaExample): A React Canvas with draggable blocks powered by Konva.
- [Pusher](https://github.com/623059008/PusherDemo): A pusher demo includes two implementations, one is based on [pusher](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) and [slanger](https://github.com/stevegraham/slanger), and another is based on Vue, [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) (my favorite websoket lib).
- [Electron Demo](https://github.com/623059008/ElectronParticleClock): An Electron particle clock application, supports Windows, MacoOS and Linux. Through this project, I figured out the way to package for different platforms, using Inno Setup to generate a Windows installer file. The particle animation is very fancy, not from me.
- [eBookFlip](https://github.com/623059008/ebookflip): eBookFlip by jQuery.
- [Horner's Method](https://github.com/623059008/Horner-s-Method/blob/master/Polynomials.html): Use Horner's Method to calculate the polynomial evaluation.
