If you have not tried Bard yet, I highly recommend giving it a try today! It is more powerful and intelligent than ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, and it has many helpful features, such as exporting answers to Google Doc and Google Mail, and even Google Colab to run the code generated by Bard. Additionally, Bard can use the latest knowledge from the internet to provide natural-sounding answers.
