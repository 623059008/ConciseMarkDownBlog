To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to highly recommend Tao for the Electric Engineering PhD at UCR. As the advisor professor of Tao, he worked at my research lab as Research Assitant almost 1 years. I witnessed his strong technical skills and dedication to his work.

Tao has worked with me in the Human Engineering Research Laboratories, where we have focused on disability rehabilitation research with information systems on embedded devices such as the Apple Watch and Fitbit. Tao has been instrumental in the development of the information system for our disability rehabilitation experiments, including data collection on the cloud, data analysis, data visualization, and rehabilitation training using technologies such as React, React Native, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, and Amazon EC2. He has also provided researchers with a low-code modularized App platform to generate customized disability rehabilitation Apps for specific data collecting devices and experimental designs.

Tao consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic and a commitment to making a positive impact on society through his research. He is a valuable member of our team and has made significant contributions to our lab. I have no doubt that Tao would excel in an  Electric Engineering PhD program. I highly recommend Tao and am confident that he will continue to excel in his studies and make meaningful contributions to the field.
