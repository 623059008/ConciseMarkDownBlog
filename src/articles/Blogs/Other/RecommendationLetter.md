Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to highly recommend Tao for the Electric Engineering PhD at UCR. As the software engineer internship at Ansys Inc., I had the pleasure of supervising Tao during their internship with us, during which they worked on a project to develop a Twin Deployer App with TypeScript, Vue, Quasar, Electron, Tornado, and Swagger.

Throughout this internship, Tao consistently impressed me with their dedication to their work and their ability to think critically and solve problems. He was responsible for developing the Twin Deployer App, including transforming it to browser mode with custom building processes and Webpack configurations, and replacing file operations in Electron mode with a File Chunk Upload component that was compatible with the browser. In addition, Tao developed the File Chunk Upload API using Tornado and Swagger, and used Tornado asyncio to implement a timed task to release cache resources. He also developed API-related data classes and models with a focus on dependency injection and object-oriented programming.

Tao consistently demonstrated strong technical skills and an ability to work well both independently and as part of a team. He was a valuable member of our team and made significant contributions to the project. I have no doubt that Tao would excel in Electric Engineering PhD program and would be a valuable asset to UCR. I wholeheartedly recommend Tao and am confident that he will continue to be qualified in his studies and make significant contributions to the field.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
